# Terafac Hiring Challenge – CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Selected Problem Statement
Option 1: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Levels Completed
- Level 1: Baseline Model (Transfer Learning – ResNet-18)
- Level 2: Intermediate Techniques (Data Augmentation & Ablation Study)
- Level 3: Advanced Architecture & Interpretability (SE Attention + Grad-CAM)
- Level 4: Expert Techniques (Ensemble Learning)

Level 5 (Research / Production Deployment) was not attempted as it is optional.

## Best Result
- Level 4 Ensemble Test Accuracy: **95.00%**

## Code & Experiments
All experiments were implemented in **Google Colab** using **PyTorch**.  
The notebook contains complete code, training logs, visualizations, and results with visible outputs.
